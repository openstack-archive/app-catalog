                  The Hyperglance application has pre-integrated
                  with OpenStack APIs to automatically provide
                  an interactive, data-rich, 3D topology
                  visualization of current OpenStack compute and
                  networking resources.  The browser client
                  allows users to easily navigate through
                  topology(ies) in 360Â°. Clearly see network
                  segments, dive into data details, analyze
                  Ceilometer metrics, plus take immediate
                  actions such as: suspend, terminate, resize,
                  etc. directly from our topology view.  If
                  using Nagios with OpenStack, Hyperglance
                  includes the ability to layer Nagios data so
                  you can see where alerts are occurring and
                  immediately tend to the alerts.  Hyperglance
                  also includes integration with AWS for true
                  hybrid cloud visibility on the same screen.
                  Through RBAC security, cloud managers can
                  enjoy multi-tenant views and actions, while
                  tenants can enjoy their own relevant views and
                  actions.  Hyperglance provides greater cloud
                  resource clarity and control.

                  Magnum is an OpenStack API service developed
                  by the OpenStack Containers Team making
                  container orchestration engines such as
                  Docker Swarm and Kubernetes available as first
                  class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses
                  Heat to orchestrate an OS image which
                  contains Docker and Kubernetes and runs that
                  image in either virtual machines or bare
                  metal in a cluster configuration.

                  This image is intended to be used with an
                  environment running Magnum.
                  See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum
                  for more information on using this image and
                  Magnum in your OpenStack environment.

         The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
         application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of
         the World Wide Web. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server,
         development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code
         stalled.

         Apache quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and
         has remained the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,

          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.

          Standalone docker implementation; employs single VM running docker service.

          Implements DockerHost interface (along with Kubernetes Pod), to unify
          docker hosting solutions, and make docker applications independent
          of one another on hosting platform.

          The Docker service is accessed using CLI client from within the same
          VM, so the docker API is not exposed outside that VM.

        Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized

        for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

        Kubernetes application; deploys a Kubernetes cluster with 3 different

          * 1 master node VM running the Kubernetes API
          * 1 or more minion nodes to be used to host user applications
          * 0 or more gateway nodes running HAProxy to route external
              traffic to provide access to  services running
              in the Kubernetes cluster.

        This application deploys all Kubernetes prerequisites, builds the
        etcd cluster and the flannel networking cluster and then configures
        Kubernetes API and other services, as appropriate for each node type.

        The application also provides API access to other applications, so
        they can create/delete Kubernetes services and Pods/Replication
        Controllers from its JSON definitions.

        Application representing a Kubernetes Pod on a given Kubernetes Cluster

        This Pod is a co-located set of docker containers which are deployed
        together on a single node and share single network space. Containers
        within a single pod can access each other using 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
        Kubernetes treats Pods as an indivisible deployment unit.

        This application also encapsulates Kubernetes Replication Controller.
        User needs to provide a count of replicas; if the number is greater
        than zero, the Replication Controller is created automatically with
        the desired number of replicas.

        The Replication Controller creates clones of the Pod (copies with the
        same container list). If a  Pod dies for any reason (for example, due
        to hosting minion failure) Replication Controller will create
        additional Pod replicas on available resources.

        The Kubernetes Pod provides an API to the host docker container that
        is compatible with Docker Standalone Host so that any Docker
        Application can be hosted on any one of them.

             build approach simplifies how new code gets integrated and consumed.
          2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
             procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
             For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that
             capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently
             and notice when it broke. Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it
             easy for you to notice when something is wrong.

        MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database
        management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Being a fork
        of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by
        the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over
        its acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share their
        copyright with the MariaDB Foundation.

        The intent is also to maintain high compatibility with MySQL,
        ensuring a âdrop-inâ replacement capability with library binary equivalency
        and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands. It includes the XtraDB
        storage engine for replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria,
        that intends to be both a transactional and non-transactional engine
        perhaps even included in future versions of MySQL.

        MongoDB (as in âhumongousâ) is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
        Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
        relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
        schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
        certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a
        combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and
        the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.

        First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in
        October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product,
        the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with
        10gen offering commercial support and other services. Since then, MongoDB
        has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites
        and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom,
        and the New York Times, among others. MongoDB is the most popular
        NoSQL database system.

        PostgreSQL, often simply âPostgresâ, is an object-relational database
        management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and
        standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to
        store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it
        later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the
        same computer or those running on another computer across a network
        (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small
        single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many
        concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database
        itself for security and scalability.

        PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is
        ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding
        locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides
        immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL
        queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other
        databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers,
        foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other
        expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by
        third parties.

        In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary
        and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them,
        by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools.
        And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that
        can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

        A bundle is the collection of Murano applications and
        their dependencies. Bundles are designed to allow the
        user to consume a group of related applications to
        address a particular use-case. Adding a bundle to
        Murano provides automated download of all the
        applications associated with that bundle at the same
        time.

        This bundle contains Docker Standalone Host and Kubernetes Pod: two
        ways (both compatible with any Docker-containerized app and
        both offering access to standard Docker APIs) of aggregating groups
        of related Docker containers on host compute/storage and network
        infrastructure, and treating these aggregations as indivisible
        deployment units. Kubernetes Pod also contains the Kubernetes
        Replication Controller, which can auto-replicate and redeploy a
        Pod with given contents in the event of Pod failure.

        This bundle contains the Zabbix Agent and Server.
        Zabbix is the ultimate enterprise-level software
        designed for monitoring availability and performance
        of IT infrastructure components.

        With Zabbix it is possible to gather virtually
        limitless types of data from the network. High
        performance real-time monitoring means that tens of
        thousands of servers, virtual machines and network
        devices can be monitored simultaneously. Along with
        storing the data, visualization features are
        available (overviews, maps, graphs, screens, etc),
        as well as very flexible ways of analyzing the data
        for the purpose of alerting.

          This template can be used to deploy and license an F5 Networks
          BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) and configure it with two interfaces.
          In this deployment, generally referred to as 'single-arm', it is
          assumed that one interface will be used for management of the BIG-IP
          VE, while the other will be used for load balancing or other
          traffic. Use of this template requires an existing VE glance image
          that has been properly onboarded.
          To onboard an image see our F5 BIG-IP VE Onboard HOT template in the
          OpenStack Application Catalog at https://apps.openstack.org/.

        Clearwater is an open source implementation of IMS (the IP Multimedia
        Subsystem) designed from the ground up for massively scalable deployment
        in the Cloud to provide voice, video and messaging services to millions
        of users. Clearwater combines the economics of over-the-top style service
        platforms with the standards compliance expected of telco-grade communications
        network solutions, and its Cloud-oriented design makes it extremely
        well suited for deployment in a
        Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.

        BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System (DNS)
        protocols for the Internet.
        It is a reference implementation of those protocols,
        but it is also production-grade software, suitable for use in high-volume
        and high-reliability applications.
        The name BIND stands for âBerkeley Internet Name Domainâ,
        because the software originated in the early 1980s
        at the University of California at Berkeley.

        BIND is by far the most widely used DNS software on the Internet,
        providing a robust and stable platform on top of which organizations
        can build distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those
        systems are fully compliant with published DNS standards.

         refstack-client is a command line utility that allows you to execute
         Tempest test runs based on configurations you specify. When finished
         running Tempest it can send the passed test data to a RefStack API server.
         More information about restack-client and how to use it can be found in README
         https://github.com/openstack/refstack-client. To become more familiar 
         with RefStack project it self, please visit https://refstack.openstack.org/

         Murano creates one VM with assigned floating IP from the image
         listed in the dependencies. After deployment, you can just ssh to this
         VM and use installed refstack-client. NOTE: Installation script uses 
         as a source the master branch from refstack-client repository.

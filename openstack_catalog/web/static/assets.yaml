                  The Hyperglance application has pre-integrated
                  with OpenStack APIs to automatically provide
                  an interactive, data-rich, 3D topology
                  visualization of current OpenStack compute and
                  networking resources.  The browser client
                  allows users to easily navigate through
                  topology(ies) in 360Â°. Clearly see network
                  segments, dive into data details, analyze
                  Ceilometer metrics, plus take immediate
                  actions such as: suspend, terminate, resize,
                  etc. directly from our topology view.  If
                  using Nagios with OpenStack, Hyperglance
                  includes the ability to layer Nagios data so
                  you can see where alerts are occurring and
                  immediately tend to the alerts.  Hyperglance
                  also includes integration with AWS for true
                  hybrid cloud visibility on the same screen.
                  Through RBAC security, cloud managers can
                  enjoy multi-tenant views and actions, while
                  tenants can enjoy their own relevant views and
                  actions.  Hyperglance provides greater cloud
                  resource clarity and control.

      description: >
                  Magnum is an OpenStack API service developed
                  by the OpenStack Containers Team making
                  container orchestration engines such as
                  Docker Swarm and Kubernetes available as first
                  class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses
                  Heat to orchestrate an OS image which
                  contains Docker and Kubernetes and runs that
                  image in either virtual machines or bare
                  metal in a cluster configuration.

                  This image is intended to be used with an
                  environment running Magnum.
                  See https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum
                  for more information on using this image and
                  Magnum in your OpenStack environment.

         This application allows the user to deploy Pivotal Operations Manager
         and configure Manager Director. To deploy this application you need to
         download Ops Manager image from network.pivotal.io and upload it to
         OpenStack with name "Ops Manager" and then mark it as a Murano image.
         After that create environment, add application to it, complete steps
         of configuring and start deployment.

         Note, you need to manually remove all VMs spawned by Ops Manager before
         deleting its environment.

         Application supports 1.6.x.x releases of Ops Manager and was tested with
         version 1.6.2.0

         Requirements for your OpenStack tenant:

         - 70 GB of RAM
         - 22 available instances
         - 16 small VMs (1 vCPU, 1024 MB of RAM, 10 GB of root disk)
         - 3 large VMs (4 vCPU, 16384 MB of RAM, 10 GB root disk)
         - 32 vCPUs
         - 1 TB of storage
         - Neutron networking with floating IP support

         Library package containing base interface for all SQL database
         implementations.

         Provides API to create a database, its users and to retrieve its
         connection string. Implementations of this interface will override
         those methods to provide DBMS-specific implementation of this interface.

         Using this interface overrides methods native to a

         The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
         application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of

         stalled.

         Apache quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and
         has remained the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
          ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine,
          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.

          Standalone docker implementation; employs single VM running docker service.

          Implements DockerHost interface (along with Kubernetes Pod), to unify
          docker hosting solutions, and make docker applications independent
          of one another on hosting platform.

          The Docker service is accessed using CLI client from within the same
          VM, so the docker API is not exposed outside that VM.

        Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized
        applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms
        for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

        Kubernetes application; deploys a Kubernetes cluster with 3 different
        node types:
          * 1 master node VM running the Kubernetes API
          * 1 or more minion nodes to be used to host user applications
          * 0 or more gateway nodes running HAProxy to route external
              traffic to provide access to  services running
              in the Kubernetes cluster.

        This application deploys all Kubernetes prerequisites, builds the
        etcd cluster and the flannel networking cluster and then configures
        Kubernetes API and other services, as appropriate for each node type.

        The application also provides API access to other applications, so
        they can create/delete Kubernetes services and Pods/Replication
        Controllers from its JSON definitions.

        Changes:
        July 2016 - The package name was changed. You can still access the application with
        the old name by the link. But now it is preferable to use the new application.

        This application uses image with follow components:
            * etcd v3.0.4;
            * kubernetes v1.3.0;
            * flannel v0.5.5;

        Application representing a Kubernetes Pod on a given Kubernetes Cluster

        This Pod is a co-located set of docker containers which are deployed
        together on a single node and share single network space. Containers
        within a single pod can access each other using 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
        Kubernetes treats Pods as an indivisible deployment unit.

        This application also encapsulates Kubernetes Replication Controller.
        User needs to provide a count of replicas; if the number is greater
        than zero, the Replication Controller is created automatically with
        the desired number of replicas.

        The Replication Controller creates clones of the Pod (copies with the
        same container list). If a  Pod dies for any reason (for example, due
        to hosting minion failure) Replication Controller will create
        additional Pod replicas on available resources.

        The Kubernetes Pod provides an API to the host docker container that
        is compatible with Docker Standalone Host so that any Docker
        Application can be hosted on any one of them.

        Changes:
        July 2016 - The package name was changed. You can still access the application with
        the old name by the link. But now it is preferable to use the new application.

        and explore data and dashboards from your disparate metric databases,
        either with your team or the world.

        Grafana is most commonly used for Internet infrastructure and application
        analytics, but many use it in other domains including industrial sensors,
        home automation, weather, and process control.

        Grafana features pluggable panels and data sources allowing easy
        extensibility. There is currently rich support for Graphite, InfluxDB
        and OpenTSDB. There is also experimental support for KairosDB, and SQL
        is on the roadmap. Grafana has a variety of panels, including a fully

        The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
        application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the
        World Wide Web. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of
        Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache
        quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained
        the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

        This applications deploys a web-site from a git URL using Apache HTTPd as
        the web server.

        Jenkins is an award-winning application that monitors executions of
        repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron.
        Among those things, current Jenkins focuses on the following two jobs:
          1. Building/testing software projects continuously, just like
             CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides
             what's known as a 'continuous integration system', to make
             it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project,
             and easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continuous
             build approach simplifies how new code gets integrated and consumed.
          2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
             procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
             For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that
             capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently
             and notice when it broke. Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it
             easy for you to notice when something is wrong.

        MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database
        management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Being a fork
        of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by
        the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over
        its acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share their
        copyright with the MariaDB Foundation.

        The intent is also to maintain high compatibility with MySQL,
        ensuring a âdrop-inâ replacement capability with library binary equivalency
        and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands. It includes the XtraDB
        storage engine for replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria,
        that intends to be both a transactional and non-transactional engine
        perhaps even included in future versions of MySQL.

        MongoDB (as in âhumongousâ) is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
        Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
        relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
        schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
        certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a
        combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and
        the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.

        First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in
        October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product,
        the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with
        10gen offering commercial support and other services. Since then, MongoDB
        has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites
        and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom,
        and the New York Times, among others. MongoDB is the most popular
        NoSQL database system.

        PostgreSQL, often simply âPostgresâ, is an object-relational database
        management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and
        standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to
        store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it
        later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the
        same computer or those running on another computer across a network
        (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small
        single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many
        concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database
        itself for security and scalability.

        PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is
        ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding
        locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides
        immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL
        queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other
        databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers,
        foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other
        expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by
        third parties.

        In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary
        and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them,
        by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools.
        And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that
        can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

        Redis is an open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store with
        optional durability. It is written in ANSI C. The development of Redis
        has been sponsored by Pivotal since May 2013; before that, it
        was sponsored by VMware. According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com,
        Redis is the most popular key-value store.

        The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.

        Murano will deploy this in the docker service of your choice;
        you'll be prompted to create a docker service or choose one
        you have deployed (e.g., via Kubernetes Pod).

        Changes:
        July 2016 - The package name was changed. You can still access the application with
        the old name by the link. But now it is preferable to use the new application.

        Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and
        servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
        Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP)
        specifications from Oracle, and provides a âpure Javaâ HTTP web server
        environment for Java code to run in. In the simplest config Tomcat
        runs in a single operating system process. The process runs a Java
        virtual machine (JVM). Every single HTTP request from a browser to
        Tomcat is processed in the Tomcat process in a separate thread.

        This bundle contains a wide range of apps for building
        (from Git), continuously-integrating, deploying and testing
        container-native, resilient and scalable data-driven and
        transaction-driven websites and applications. All components in
        this bundle can be deployed on DockerStandaloneHost or
        KubernetesPod/Cluster.
        Included in the bundle are:
          *  Web server options: Market-leading Apache and high-performing,
             tunable Nginx, in simplex versions as well as versions rigged
             to automatically deploy a website from a given Git repository.
          *  Java engine options: Glassfish application server
             (open source Java EE) and Tomcat.
          *  NoSQL and specialized databases: InfluxDB for storing
             metrics and sensor data (with no external dependencies).
             MongoDB for object/document storage, Redis for key/value storage.
          *  Leading SQL databases: MySQL, the increasingly-popular MariaDB
             and Crate for massively-scalable elastic SQL storage.
          *  Grafana for visualizing large-scale measurement data.
          *  Plus: Jenkins for automating continuous builds
             and monitoring remote job execution.

        This bundle contains Docker Standalone Host and Kubernetes Pod: two
        ways (both compatible with any Docker-containerized app and
        both offering access to standard Docker APIs) of aggregating groups
        of related Docker containers on host compute/storage and network
        infrastructure, and treating these aggregations as indivisible
        deployment units. Kubernetes Pod also contains the Kubernetes
        Replication Controller, which can auto-replicate and redeploy a
        Pod with given contents in the event of Pod failure.

        With this bundle automatically will be installed application -
        "Kubernetes Cluster". It uses image with follow components:
            * etcd v3.0.4;
            * kubernetes v1.3.0;
            * flannel v0.5.5;

        Zabbix is the ultimate enterprise-level software
        designed for monitoring availability and performance
        of IT infrastructure components.

        With Zabbix it is possible to gather virtually
        limitless types of data from the network. High
        performance real-time monitoring means that tens of
        thousands of servers, virtual machines and network
        devices can be monitored simultaneously. Along with
        storing the data, visualization features are
        available (overviews, maps, graphs, screens, etc),
        as well as very flexible ways of analyzing the data
        for the purpose of alerting.

        The name BIND stands for âBerkeley Internet Name Domainâ,
        because the software originated in the early 1980s
        at the University of California at Berkeley.

        BIND is by far the most widely used DNS software on the Internet,
        providing a robust and stable platform on top of which organizations
        can build distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those
        systems are fully compliant with published DNS standards.

         refstack-client is a command line utility that allows you to execute
         Tempest test runs based on configurations you specify. When finished
         running Tempest it can send the passed test data to a RefStack API server.
         More information about restack-client and how to use it can be found in README
         https://github.com/openstack/refstack-client. To become more familiar
         with RefStack project it self, please visit https://refstack.openstack.org/

         Murano creates one VM with assigned floating IP from the image
         listed in the dependencies. After deployment, you can just ssh to this
         VM and use installed refstack-client. NOTE: Installation script uses
         as a source the master branch from refstack-client repository.

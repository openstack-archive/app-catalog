          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
          ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine,
          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.

          Standalone docker implementation; employs single VM running docker service.

          Implements DockerHost interface (along with Kubernetes Pod), to unify
          docker hosting solutions, and make docker applications independent
          of one another on hosting platform.

          The Docker service is accessed using CLI client from within the same
          VM, so the docker API is not exposed outside VM.

        Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized
        applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms
        for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

        Kubernetes application; deploys a Kubernetes cluster with 3 different
        node types:
          * 1 master node VM running the Kubernetes API
          * 1 or more minion nodes to be used to host user applications
          * 0 or more gateway nodes running HAProxy to route external
              traffic to provide access to  services running
              in the Kubernetes cluster.

        This application deploys all Kubernetes prerequisites, builds the
        etcd cluster and the flannel networking cluster and then configures
        Kubernetes API and other services, as appropriate for each node type.

        The application also provides API access to other applications, so
        they can create/delete Kubernetes services and Pods/Replication
        Controllers from its JSON definitions.

        Application representing a Kubernetes Pod on a given Kubernetes Cluster

        Pod is a colocated set of docker containers which are deployed
        together on a single node and share single network space. Containers
        within a single pod can access each other using 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
        Kubernetes treats Pods as an indivisible deployment unit.

        This application also encapsulates Kubernetes Replication Controller.
        User is asked to provide count of replicas; if the number is greater
        than zero, the Replication Controller is created automatically with
        the desired number of replicas.

        The Replication Controller creates clones of the Pod (copies with the
        same container list). If a  Pod dies for any reason (for example, due
        to hosting minion failure) Replication Controller will create
        additional Pod replicas on available resources.

        The Kubernetes Pod provides an API to the host docker container that
        is compatible with Docker Standalone Host so that any Docker
        Application can be hosted on any of them.

        World Wide Web. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server, development of
        Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code stalled. Apache
        quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and has remained
        the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

        This applications deploys a web-site from a git URL using Apache HTTPd as
        the web server.

        Jenkins is an award-winning application that monitors executions of
        repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron.
        Among those things, current Jenkins focuses on the following two jobs:
          1. Building/testing software projects continuously, just like
             CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides an
             easy-to-use so-called continuous integration system, making
             it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project,
             and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
             The automated, continuous build increases the productivity.
          2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
             procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
             For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that
             capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently
             and notice when it broke. Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it
             easy for you to notice when something is wrong.

        MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database
        management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Being a fork
        of a leading open source software system, it is notable for being led by
        the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over
        its acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share their
        copyright with the MariaDB Foundation.

        The intent is also to maintain high compatibility with MySQL,
        ensuring a “drop-in” replacement capability with library binary equivalency
        and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands. It includes the XtraDB
        storage engine for replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria,
        that intends to be both a transactional and non-transactional engine
        perhaps even included in future versions of MySQL.

        MongoDB (from “humongous”) is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
        Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
        relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
        schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
        certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a
        combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and
        the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.

        First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in
        October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product,
        the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with
        10gen offering commercial support and other services. Since then, MongoDB
        has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites
        and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom,
        and the New York Times, among others. MongoDB is the most popular
        NoSQL database system.

        PostgreSQL, often simply “Postgres”, is an object-relational database
        management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and
        standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to
        store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it
        later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the
        same computer or those running on another computer across a network
        (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small
        single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many
        concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database
        itself for security and scalability.

        PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is
        ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding
        locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides
        immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL
        queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other
        databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers,
        foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other
        expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by
        third parties.

        In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary
        and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them,
        by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools.
        And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that
        can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

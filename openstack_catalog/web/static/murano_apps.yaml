          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
          ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine,
          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.

          Standalone docker implementation; employs single VM running docker service.

          Implements DockerHost interface (along with Kubernetes Pod), to unify
          docker hosting solutions, and make docker applications independent
          of one another on hosting platform.

          The Docker service is accessed using CLI client from within the same
          VM, so the docker API is not exposed outside VM.

        Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized
        applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms
        for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

        Kubernetes application; deploys a Kubernetes cluster with 3 different
        node types:
          * 1 master node VM running the Kubernetes API
          * 1 or more minion nodes to be used to host user applications
          * 0 or more gateway nodes running HAProxy to route external
              traffic to provide access to  services running
              in the Kubernetes cluster.

        This application deploys all Kubernetes prerequisites, builds the
        etcd cluster and the flannel networking cluster and then configures
        Kubernetes API and other services, as appropriate for each node type.

        The application also provides API access to other applications, so
        they can create/delete Kubernetes services and Pods/Replication
        Controllers from its JSON definitions.

        Application representing a Kubernetes Pod on a given Kubernetes Cluster

        Pod is a colocated set of docker containers which are deployed
        together on a single node and share single network space. Containers
        within a single pod can access each other using 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
        Kubernetes treats Pods as an indivisible deployment unit.

        This application also encapsulates Kubernetes Replication Controller.
        User is asked to provide count of replicas; if the number is greater
        than zero, the Replication Controller is created automatically with
        the desired number of replicas.

        The Replication Controller creates clones of the Pod (copies with the
        same container list). If a  Pod dies for any reason (for example, due
        to hosting minion failure) Replication Controller will create
        additional Pod replicas on available resources.

        The Kubernetes Pod provides an API to the host docker container that
        is compatible with Docker Standalone Host so that any Docker
        Application can be hosted on any of them.

         The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
         application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of

         stalled.

         Apache quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and
         has remained the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

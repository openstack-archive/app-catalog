          Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,
          ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine,
          a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
          a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows,
          Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and
          eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production
          environments.

         The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
         application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of
         the World Wide Web. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server,
         development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code
         stalled.

         Apache quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and
         has remained the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

         Library package containing base interface for all SQL database
         implementations.

         Provides API to create a database, its users and to retrieve its
         connection string. Implementations of this interface will override
         those methods to provide DBMS-specific implementation of this interface.

         Using this interface overrides methods native to a
         specific database for these
         three basic functions (creating a database, users, or retrieving a
         connection string).

         The Apache HTTP Server, colloquially called Apache, is a Web server
         application notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of
         the World Wide Web. Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server,
         development of Apache began in early 1995 after work on the NCSA code
         stalled.

         Apache quickly overtook NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server, and
         has remained the most popular HTTP server in use since April 1996.

        than zero, the Replication Controller is created automatically with
        the desired number of replicas.

        The Replication Controller creates clones of the Pod (copies with the
        same container list). If a  Pod dies for any reason (for example, due
        to hosting minion failure) Replication Controller will create
        additional Pod replicas on available resources.

        The Kubernetes Pod provides an API to the host docker container that
        is compatible with Docker Standalone Host so that any Docker
        Application can be hosted on any one of them.

        Jenkins is an award-winning application that monitors executions of
        repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron.
        Among those things, current Jenkins focuses on the following two jobs:
          1. Building/testing software projects continuously, just like
             CruiseControl or DamageControl. In a nutshell, Jenkins provides
             what's known as a 'continuous integration system', to make
             it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project,
             and easier for users to obtain a fresh build. The automated, continuous
             build approach simplifies how new code gets integrated and consumed.
          2. Monitoring executions of externally-run jobs, such as cron jobs and
             procmail jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
             For example, with cron, all you receive is regular e-mails that
             capture the output, and it is up to you to look at them diligently
             and notice when it broke. Jenkins keeps those outputs and makes it
             easy for you to notice when something is wrong.

        MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database

        its acquisition by Oracle. Contributors are required to share their
        copyright with the MariaDB Foundation.

        The intent is also to maintain high compatibility with MySQL,
        ensuring a “drop-in” replacement capability with library binary equivalency
        and exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands. It includes the XtraDB
        storage engine for replacing InnoDB, as well as a new storage engine, Aria,

        MongoDB (as in “humongous”) is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
        Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
        relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic
        schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in
        certain types of applications easier and faster. Released under a
        combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and
        the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.

        First developed by the software company 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.) in
        October 2007 as a component of a planned platform as a service product,
        the company shifted to an open source development model in 2009, with
        10gen offering commercial support and other services. Since then, MongoDB
        has been adopted as backend software by a number of major websites
        and services, including Craigslist, eBay, Foursquare, SourceForge, Viacom,
        and the New York Times, among others. MongoDB is the most popular
        NoSQL database system.

        Nginx (pronounced “engine-x”) is an open source reverse proxy server for
        HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer,
        HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server).

        The Nginx project started with a strong focus on high concurrency,
        high performance and low memory usage. It is licensed under
        the 2-clause BSD-like license and it runs on Linux, BSD variants,
        Mac OS X, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, as well as on other *nix flavors.

        This applications deploys a web-site from a git URL using Nginx as
        the web server.

        PostgreSQL, often simply “Postgres”, is an object-relational database
        management system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and
        standards-compliance. As a database server, its primary function is to
        store data, securely and supporting best practices, and retrieve it
        later, as requested by other software applications, be it those on the
        same computer or those running on another computer across a network
        (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from small
        single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many
        concurrent users. Recent versions also provide replication of the database
        itself for security and scalability.

        PostgreSQL implements the majority of the SQL:2011 standard, is
        ACID-compliant and transactional (including most DDL statements) avoiding
        locking issues using multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), provides
        immunity to dirty reads and full serializability; handles complex SQL
        queries using many indexing methods that are not available in other
        databases; has updateable views and materialized views, triggers,
        foreign keys; supports functions and stored procedures, and other
        expandability, and has a large number of extensions written by
        third parties.

        In addition to the possibility of working with the major proprietary
        and open source databases, PostgreSQL supports migration from them,
        by its extensive standard SQL support and available migration tools.
        And if proprietary extensions had been used, by its extensibility that
        can emulate many through some built-in and third-party open source.

        Redis is an open-source, networked, in-memory, key-value data store with
        optional durability. It is written in ANSI C. The development of Redis
        has been sponsored by Pivotal since May 2013; before that, it
        was sponsored by VMware. According to the monthly ranking by DB-Engines.com,
        Redis is the most popular key-value store.

        The name Redis means REmote DIctionary Server.

        Apache Tomcat (or simply Tomcat) is an open source web server and
        servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF).
        Tomcat implements the Java Servlet and the JavaServer Pages (JSP)
        specifications from Oracle, and provides a “pure Java” HTTP web server
        environment for Java code to run in. In the simplest config Tomcat
        runs in a single operating system process. The process runs a Java
        virtual machine (JVM). Every single HTTP request from a browser to
        Tomcat is processed in the Tomcat process in a separate thread.

        A bundle is the collection of Murano applications and
        their dependencies. Bundles are designed to allow the
        user to consume a group of related applications to
        address a particular use-case. Adding a bundle to
        Murano provides automated download of all the
        applications associated with that bundle at the same
        time.

        This bundle contains the Apache HTTP Server and Apache Tomcat: an
        open source server-side executive for Java Servlets and JavaServer
        Pages. The bundle provides a flexible, familiar environment for
        developing websites and applications that use Java for server-side
        processing. Each request from a browser is processed by
        Tomcat in a separate thread.

        thousands of servers, virtual machines and network
        devices can be monitored simultaneously. Along with
        storing the data, visualization features are

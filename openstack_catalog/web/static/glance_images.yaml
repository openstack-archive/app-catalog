                  The GitLab open source edition,
                  available from Bitnami, is a developer
                  tool that allows users to collaborate on
                  code, create new projects, manage
                  repositories, and perform code reviews.
                  When using GitLab, users can keep their
                  code on their own servers, either in the
                  cloud or on-premise. For additional
                  peace of mind, the free community
                  edition even features enterprise-grade
                  features such as a mature user
                  permissions scheme and support for high
                  availability. Bitnami GitLab is bundled
                  with GitLab CI, a continuous integration
                  server. Just point your projects at the
                  CI server and automate all your tests.

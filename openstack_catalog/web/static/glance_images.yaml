                  The Chef server acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef
                  server stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to nodes,
                  and metadata that describes each registered node that is being
                  managed by the chef-client. Nodes use the chef-client to ask the
                  Chef server for configuration details, such as recipes,
                  templates, and file distributions.

                  The user to login is openstack-user.

                  This is a CentOS 6.6 base image with cloud_init using

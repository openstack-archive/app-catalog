Clearly see network segments, dive into data details, analyze Ceilometer metrics, plus take immediate actions such as: suspend, terminate, resize, etc. directly from our topology view.  If using Nagios with OpenStack, Hyperglance includes the ability to layer Nagios data so you can see where alerts are occurring and immediately tend to the alerts.  Hyperglance also includes integration with AWS for true hybrid cloud visibility on the same screen. Through RBAC security, cloud managers can enjoy multi-tenant views and actions, while tenants can enjoy their own relevant views and actions.
